# Edit the Code

As you know you can clone the repo to your local memmory and the best part is You can try to edit and deploy it for practice your skill or in case you just want to know about the website. and i will show you how to clone repository to your local memmory. All you guys need to do is just follow the instruction here.

## Copy Link

Make a New folder to clone the repository and Copy link from the repository on the green button (**<>code**) click it and you see there's a link copy it and you can go to next step. 
![Clone Github Repository]()

## Open Gitbash

Now open your gitbash (hope you already install it) and you need a new folder to save the file and type this line
```
git clone <link from github>
```
wait the process finish.

## Open the Folder

and you can see the file from my git repository. You can edit it and try something good but you hvae to install Visualcode for editing the HTML file and the display will be like this.

![Visualcode Display]

#Deployment

this is the best part you can deploy your own website this is the instruction i will show you about the free one and the paid one

## Netlify

you can browse what is Netlify or you can click here to go to the website [NETLIFY](https://www.netlify.com/). but we gonna use this for the free one you can use your code to repository or you can deploy manual. but if you deploy manual if you have an update about you website it will change automatic you have to deploy again but if you use repository fromm github every update will be show you don't have to upload just wait and refesh and you will see the update. The free one you can't choose the domain name, you can change the domain with but it will show like this **<your link>**.netlify.app and here's the preview.

![Netlify Deploy Manual]

![Netlify Deploy from Github]

## The Paid One

This is the paid one the step will be more than the free one but you can choose the domain name like **<your link>**.com, **<your link>**.id or anything you want. here's the step to deploy with the paid website and you can choose the domain name. but you still have to deploy to netlify before set the domain name.

### Buy Domain Name

Before you set the website the most important thing is buy the domain name as you can see i just buy the domain **rekaprima.site** i just bought from [NIAGA HOSTER](https://www.niagahoster.co.id/) i just bought .site because it's very cheap it only take Rp. 17.000 for 1 year
you just have to Log in to Niaga Hoster and buy some domain wait the verification after verification you will see this menu on Niaga Hoster

![Buy Domain Name]

### Cloudflare

you can browse again about what is cloudflare or you can click here [CLOUDFLARE](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare is really important for a deploying a website because cloudflare have much features for us like the security from DDoS Attack and Cloudflare have a CDN feature. but first you have to Login to Cloudflare. and you will see like this you just have to put your domain name that you bought earlier.


### Change Server Name

after you put your domain name on cloudflare you will get server name you just have to put to Niaga Hoster (if you bought the domain name on Niaga Hoster just follow this instruction) you just have go to **Layanan** -> **Layanan Saya** and you will see the domain name you bought before just click **Kelola Layanan** and you will see this. Just Click **Ubah Nama Server** and put server name from cloudflare. Be careful cloudflare give us two names server you have to input the two names server from cloudflare to Niaga Hoster.


### Setting DNS External From Cloudflare

next step is back to cloudflare to setting the DNS you just have go to DNS menu and you will see this. You just have to add record on DNS Management Menu. Choose **Type CNAME** and put your netlify domain name on the **Name Input** (after you deploy the website for the first time you will get the random name from netlify and you just have to put the random name from netlify to DNS Setting) and put you custom domain name on **IPv4 Address** add record choose the type CNAME again and put the **www** to name input and put your custom domain to IPv4 Address. and here's the example.


### Back to Netlify

After the all the process success you will see the link active on cloudflare you just have to set the custom domain to netlify and just wait till the process finish and custom domain name will be ready to use. here's the example





## --FINISH THE DEPLOY AND ENJOY YOUR WEBSITE--
